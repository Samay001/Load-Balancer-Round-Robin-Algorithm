Load Balancer with Docker & Kubernetes
This project demonstrates a simple Load Balancer setup using Docker and Kubernetes, designed to balance traffic across multiple instances of server applications. The load balancer handles requests by distributing them between replicas, ensuring reliability and availability.

Features
Multi-Instance Load Balancing: Traffic is distributed between two server instances.
Dynamic Scaling with Kubernetes: Replica management is handled through Kubernetes for high availability.
Dockerized Environment: Both server instances are Dockerized for easy deployment.
Switching Active Instances: Routes allow instances to stop and restart, ensuring continued service without downtime.
